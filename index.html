            <h3>Assassin's Creed Odyssey is an action role-playing video game</h3>
            <p>The plot is set in a fictional history of real-world events, but unlike other games in the series, it doesn't focus on the conflict between the Assassin Brotherhood and the Templar Order.[c] The main narrative is set in the years 431–422 BC and tells a mythological history of the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta. Players control a male or female mercenary (Ancient Greek: μίσθιος misthios) who fights on both sides of the conflict as they attempt to find their family. The modern-day portion of the story is set in the 21st century and continues from the events of Origins, as Layla Hassan, now an Assassin agent, searches for Atlantis and a powerful artifact it houses.</p>

                <p>known as the Eagle Bearer, West Wind, or Keeper, was a Spartan mercenary who fought during  the Peloponnesian War.During her travels as a mercenary, Kassandra came into conflict with the secretive Cult of Kosmos, an organization intent on controlling the entire Greek world. She later opposed the Order of the Ancients, who sought to hunt her down, due in part to her nature as a Tainted One, and also for her allying herself with Darius. For her opposition against the Cult and the Order, Kassandra is considered one of the early precursors to the Assassin Brotherhood.</p>

                <p> known as Deimos, was a Sage of the Cult of Kosmos, an organization based in ancient Greece.
                    Alongside his sister, the famed misthios Kassandra the Eagle Bearer, he was a grandchild of King Leonidas I of Sparta through his mother, Myrrine, and a Hybrid. His unique heritage made him the target of the Cult of Kosmos as an infant and a false oracle delivered by the Cult deceived Sparta into believing he had to be thrown off Mount Taygetos to his death. Although he survived the fall, he was abducted by the Cultist Chrysis and forced to endure a cruel and torturous childhood. His harsh upbringing warped
