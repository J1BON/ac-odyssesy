            <h3>Assassin's Creed Odyssey is an action role-playing video game</h3>
            <p>The plot is set in a fictional history of real-world events, but unlike other games in the series, it doesn't focus on the conflict between the Assassin Brotherhood and the Templar Order.[c] The main narrative is set in the years 431–422 BC and tells a mythological history of the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta. Players control a male or female mercenary (Ancient Greek: μίσθιος misthios) who fights on both sides of the conflict as they attempt to find their family. The modern-day portion of the story is set in the 21st century and continues from the events of Origins, as Layla Hassan, now an Assassin agent, searches for Atlantis and a powerful artifact it houses.</p>
